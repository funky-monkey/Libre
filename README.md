#Libre
###*Stop wresteling with Core Data. Libre sets you free!*

Libre is a set of extension classes for Core Data written in Swift 1.2. 

Never wrestle again with Core Data.

##Why Libre?
I used to wrestle alot with Core Data - I still do. Libre means **free, having liberty, at liberty** - The thing I want to be when working with database abstraction libraries. It's the thing you get while use this set of awesome classes. 

Plus it's opensource - which is also 'libre', get it? But most of all it's a cool sounding name.
