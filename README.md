#Libre
###*Stop wresteling with Core Data. Libre sets you free!*

Libre is a set of extension classes for Core Data written in Swift 1.2. 

Never wrestle again with Core Data.

##Why Libre?
I used to wrestle alot with Core Data - I still do. Libre means **free, having liberty, at liberty** - The thing I want to be when working with database abstraction libraries. The thing you get while use this set of awesome classes. 

Plus it's opensource - which is also 'libre', get it? but most of all it's a cool sounding name. The project I used this on had a placeholderimage of a wrestler mask. Like the logo. (I really want to give credit to the original author of this icon - If you know who, please let me know!)
